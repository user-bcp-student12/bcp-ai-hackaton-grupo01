# Coding standards: Fastify (TypeScript backend)

Use these only if `## Project` in `AGENTS.md` says the backend is TypeScript + Fastify. Stack: Fastify 5 on Node LTS, Zod through `fastify-type-provider-zod`, Vitest. Use the versions `scaffold` installed.

## App structure

The architecture is pragmatic hexagonal (`backend-architecture.instructions.md`). In Fastify:

- `buildApp(deps)` in `app.ts` is the **composition root**: it creates the adapters (or takes them from `deps`, which is how tests pass in-memory ones), builds the use cases with them, and registers each feature's routes. `server.ts` only calls `buildApp()` and `listen()`. Tests never open a port.
- Use cases are plain functions or classes in `<feature>/application/`, taking their ports as arguments: `createItem({ items, clock })`. They never import Fastify.
- Ports are TypeScript interfaces in `<feature>/application/ports.ts`. Adapters implement them: `DrizzleItemRepository`, `InMemoryItemRepository`.
- Each feature's `adapters/http/routes.ts` is a Fastify plugin that receives its use cases as plugin options and is registered with a prefix. Handlers stay thin: the schema validates, the handler maps the input, calls the use case, maps the result.
- Wrap a plugin in `fastify-plugin` only when it must share decorators or hooks with its parent (auth, request context). Pass use cases through options, not `decorate`, so each feature only sees what it uses.
- Close resources (DB pool, clients) in an `onClose` hook registered by the composition root.
- Config: parse `process.env` with a Zod schema once at startup, fail fast if it's invalid, and pass the typed config into `buildApp()`.

## Routes and the Contracts

- Every route declares `schema` with `body`, `querystring`, `params` and **`response`** for each status, built from the shared contract schemas. Use `.withTypeProvider<ZodTypeProvider>()` so the handler's types come from the schema.
- The `response` schema is the contract: Fastify serializes through it and **drops fields it doesn't declare**. If a field goes missing in the response, check the schema first.
- `async` handlers **return** the payload. Set the status with `reply.code(201)` before returning. Never mix `return` and `reply.send()` in one handler.
- Paths, methods, status codes and field names match `design.md` exactly.

## Errors

- One `setErrorHandler` maps errors to the documented error shape: validation errors to 400 with details, domain errors to their status, anything else to 500 with a generic message, logged with the full error.
- Use cases throw domain errors (`class ItemNotFound extends DomainError`), with no status code. The error handler maps each domain error class to its status in one table. Don't build error replies in each handler.
- Set a `setNotFoundHandler` that returns the same error shape.

## Logging and external calls

- Log with `request.log` (pino) inside requests and `app.log` outside, as objects: `request.log.info({ itemId }, "item created")`. No `console.log`.
- Outbound calls (LLM, third-party APIs) are adapters in `<feature>/adapters/<service>/` implementing a port, with a timeout (`AbortSignal.timeout(ms)`). Map their failures to a domain error, plus the demo fallback when the issue is `priority:p0`.
- CORS through `@fastify/cors`, limited to the frontend's origin from config.

## Tests

- **Use cases:** Vitest unit tests that call the use case with in-memory adapters. Most WHEN/THEN scenarios are tested here.
- **Routes:** `const app = await buildApp({ config, ...inMemoryDeps })` and `app.inject({ method, url, payload })`. Assert the status and the body against the contract schema, including a validation failure (400) for each route that takes input. Call `app.close()` after each test.
- Replace adapters by passing fakes into `buildApp()`, never with `vi.mock` of modules.

## This project

Use one local SQLite database with `node:sqlite` after the scaffold's Node 24
Windows compatibility probe. Parameterized SQL, foreign keys and explicit
transactions are required; no silent in-memory fallback. Money is PEN integer
cents. KYC and opening funds are simulations, never real provider integrations.
Document exact installed versions during scaffold. Session tokens and passwords
are stored only as hashes; redact credentials and personal fields from logs.
